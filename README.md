#Solid compact 3d printer

This printer is made to be as solid and compact at possible. Using aluminium plates as a framework. Parts might be sub-optimal, but that was what I has laying around.

All larts machined using a small DIY cnc router

Design goals:
Plastic types:
TBA - Need more research
Build volume:
At least 200x200x200mm.

Motion:
Nema 23 steppers 1.8 degree/24(or 36) volts. 2 A max
Linear rails on all axies

Electronics:
Nothing custom planned, everything off the shelf
MKS Gen 3D Printer Control Board
TMC2200 drivers
Some PSU (TBA)
Raspberry Pi 3+ running octoprint and Klipper for motion controll.

Printing:
Some off the shelf extruder. TBA.
