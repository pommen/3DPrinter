#Solid compact 3d printer

This printer is made to be as solid and compact at possible. Using aluminium plates as a framework. Parts might be sub-optimal, but that was what I has laying around.

All parts machined using a small DIY cnc router.

Design goals:
Plastic types:
TBA - Need more research
Build volume:
At least 200x200x200mm.

Motion:
Nema 23 steppers 1.8 degree/24volts. 2 A max
Linear rails on all axies MGN type. Trapezoidal screws for motion coupling.

Electronics:
Nothing custom planned, everything is off the shelf type
MKS Gen L 3D Printer Control Board
TMC2200 drivers
24V 10A PSU
Raspberry Pi 3B+ running octoprint and Klipper for motion controll.
An compatible LCD screen with encoder.
